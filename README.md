## How to generate data?
Just run `python generate_data.py` (may be different throughout different PCs). This will create a folder called dataset (if not created), with 3 folder with each type: small (2^9), medium (2^13), big (2^16) element.

#### You can also test each algorithm by running the files. I have configured a numpy assertion where it should return true if the data is the same.
